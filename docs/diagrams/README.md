# Diagrams

Store Mermaid source files for schema and process diagrams in this folder.

## Guidance

- Prefer `erDiagram` for data model diagrams.
- Prefer `flowchart` for sync/process flow diagrams.
- Keep diagrams focused by concern; avoid one oversized all-in-one diagram.
- Use stable entity/node names that match table and route names in code.

## Suggested files

- `inventory-erd.mmd`
- `api-flow.mmd`
